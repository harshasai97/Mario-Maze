# About the Game

In this game scenario, Mario is positioned within a maze, while enemies are scattered at random locations. Upon interacting with Mario, he initiates an algorithm to compute the most efficient route to eliminate all enemies within the maze. This involves calculating the shortest path that allows Mario to defeat every enemy in the least amount of moves or time. The game objective is successfully completed once Mario has defeated all enemies, optimizing his movement to minimize the time and steps taken. This logic can be implemented using pathfinding algorithms such Dijkstra's Algorithm, ensuring that Mario strategically navigates the maze to achieve victory.
